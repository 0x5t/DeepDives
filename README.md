### Overview

**DeepDives** is a curated collection of detailed writeups on **CVEs**. Each entry provides a structured analysis of a vulnerability, covering:

- **Context** — affected systems, versions, and attack surface
- **Root Cause** — the underlying coding or design flaw that enables exploitation
- **Exploitability** — how the vulnerability can be abused in practice, including PoCs
- **Lessons Learned** — takeaways for exploit development and vulnerability research

The objective of this repository is to **document, analyze, and learn** from real-world vulnerabilities by studying them as an attacker would.

│
├── CVE-XXXX-YYYY/
│   ├── README.md       # Attacker analysis
│   └── poc/            # Proof-of-concept exploit

└── TEMPLATE.md         # Standardized writeup template
└── README.md           # Explaining what this repo is for ;)
```
---

### Methodology

Every writeup follows a standardized framework to ensure consistency:

1. **Overview** — CVE description, impact, CVSS score
2. **Root Cause** — why the bug exists at a code/design level
3. **Exploitation** — step-by-step attacker perspective, with linked PoC
4. **Lessons Learned** — attacker takeaways and patterns to look for

---

### Example Writeup

See [`CVE-XXXX-YYYY`](https://github.com/R4ptX/DeepDives/tree/main/CVE-XXXX-YYYY) for a sample breakdown.<br>
Each writeup is self-contained and includes links to external advisories or research.
